  <h1 class="ion-text-center">TRAILSTEPS PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy has been developed in line with TrailSteps’s commitment
    to privacy and describes how TrailSteps treat the information it collects
    and shares when you visit the TrailSteps website (www.trailsteps.com),
    hereinafter referred to as the “Site”, owned and operated by the Delaware
    Corporation Hubstir LLC, hereinafter referred to as “TrailSteps” or “we”,
    “us” or “our”.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is effective immediately for users registering
    TrailSteps accounts after the date of last update hereinabove and will
    become effective 30 days after said date for pre-existing users.
  </p>
  <p>
    By visiting the Site, you are accepting this Privacy Policy. As the Site
    will develop and evolve over time, this Privacy Policy may change to reflect
    that. Your continued use of the Site following the effective date
    hereinabove means you accept the changes. You agree that notices we may
    provide on the Site itself shall be deemed reasonable notice for this
    purpose. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we
    may make to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">1. Collected and Disclosed Information</h3>
  <p>
    1.1 TrailSteps may request information from you in order to grant you access
    to selected content of the Site. TrailSteps may use this information to
    contact you regarding your relationship with the Site and to provide
    services that you have requested. TrailSteps may share your information with
    vendors we select as necessary to provide products or services you have
    requested or to provide information about products or services that may be
    of interest to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.2 Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, your personal information
    will not be used for promotional purposes without your consent. However, if
    you choose to fill out any user surveys, or participate in a contest,
    demographic information that you submit about yourself may be shared with
    associated sponsors and business partners in aggregate form.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.3 Information collected in aggregate form includes the number of visitors
    to the Site, how long they stay, the pages they visit, the trails and
    locations they select, anonymized review content and trail share statistics.
    TrailSteps collects these kinds of aggregate user information to help
    continually improve content and services, and to sell sponsorships of the
    Site to appropriate advertisers. This aggregate user information is
    disclosed to advertisers, but note that advertisers do not have any
    influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the Site. In
    addition, TrailSteps collects in aggregate form information from visitors
    who click on advertisements to enable measurement of interest in the various
    areas of the Site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen
    or clicked on their ads. TrailSteps also uses demographic and preference
    information in aggregate form only to allow advertising banners on the Site
    to be targeted to the readers for whom they are most pertinent.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.4 TrailSteps cooperates with all law-enforcement inquiries, official
    investigations and legal proceedings initiated by governmental and/or law
    enforcement officials, and reserves the right to disclose personally
    identifying and/or aggregate information in connection with a subpoena or
    other court-sanctioned demand for such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.5 Nothing in this Privacy Policy is meant to impede TrailSteps’s right or
    ability to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets.
    TrailSteps reserves the right to share your information with any successor
    to TrailSteps’s business, subject to acceptance by said any successor of all
    obligations under this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.6 TrailSteps reserves the right to use the information it collects about
    your computer, mobile or other device (including its geographical location),
    which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose,
    including, without limitation, to help diagnosis problems with its servers,
    to gather broad demographic information, analyze trends, track users'
    movements around the Site and to otherwise administer the Site. Geographic
    location information about you and/or your computer, mobile or other device
    may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored messaging based
    on geographic location. TrailSteps reserves the right to use, transfer, sell
    and share aggregated anonymous data about its users as a group for any
    lawful business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking
    compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">
    2. IP Addresses; Cookies and Other Tracking Technology
  </h3>
  <p>
    2.1 TrailSteps logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, or the location of
    your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and
    troubleshooting purposes. TrailSteps uses the IP address log in an aggregate
    fashion to track access to the Site.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.2 As is standard practice on many web sites, the Site uses “cookies” and
    other similar technologies such as clear gifs (collectively "Local Device
    Storage") to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help
    understand which parts of the Site are the most popular, where its visitors
    are going, and how much time they spend there. TrailSteps reserves the right
    to place cookies on your computer with unique anonymous numbers for purposes
    such as to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over
    again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique
    visitors that have viewed a particular ad/or visited a particular web page.
    You may decline Local Device Storage by using the appropriate feature of
    your web software, if available; however, declining to use Local Device
    Storage may impede the ability of the Site to function properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.3 In addition, TrailSteps may use a third-party advertising company to
    serve ads when you visit the Site. This company may use information (not
    including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about
    your visit to the Site, including IP address, in order to provide
    advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you.
    In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, said third-party
    advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser
  </p>
  <p>
    2.4 In addition to Local Device Storage, TrailSteps may use web beacons, web
    bugs and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device
    Storage, the "Tracking Technologies"). Tracking Technologies are used for
    all or some of the same lawful business purposes we described hereinbefore
    for the use of Local Device Storage.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ion-text-left">3. User Generated Content</h3>
  <p>
    Please remember that any personal information you disclose in e.g. user
    reviews becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
    deciding to disclose your personal information. If you send e-mails, you
    should be aware that information disclosed in e-mails may not be secure or
    encrypted and, thus, may be available to others. We suggest that you
    exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential
    information in e-mails or via the Internet.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">4. E-mails</h3>
  <p>
    4.1 TrailSteps will use your e-mail address to respond directly to your
    questions or comments. Except to provide you with products and services you
    have requested, TrailSteps will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any
    third party to use your e-mail address without providing you the opportunity
    to opt-out of such use. If it is ever requested that you volunteer
    additional information, such as age (e.g., in an online survey), your
    response will always be voluntary. You can unsubscribe to any e-mail you
    receive from TrailSteps by following the instructions in the e-mail. If you
    feel you have received an e-mail from us in error, please contact
    <b>privacy@trailsteps.com</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.2 Account and Service-Related E-mails TrailSteps reserves the right to
    send you e-mails relating to your account status. This includes order
    confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit-card problems,
    other transactional e-mails and notifications about major changes to the
    Site and/or to this Privacy Policy. If you have registered for online
    discussions or other services, you may receive e-mails specific to your
    participation in those activities. If you participate in an online survey,
    or submit a sweepstakes or contest entry, you may receive a confirmation
    e-mail.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.3 Promotional E-mails Certain parts of the Site may give you the option to
    receive periodic emails from TrailSteps about products and services it
    considers may be of interest to you. If you opt-in to receive these e-mails,
    you can choose not to receive additional messages in the future by following
    the instructions in the e-mails.
  </p>
  <p>
    TrailSteps may send you an e-mail inviting you to participate in user
    surveys, asking for feedback on the Site and existing or prospective
    products and services, as well as information to better understand our
    users. User surveys greatly help us to improve the Site, and any information
    so obtained will not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate and
    anonymized form.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">5. Social Networking Service</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to access, visit and/or use any third-party social networking
    service(s) that may be integrated with the Site, TrailSteps may receive
    personally identifiable information and other information about you and your
    computer, mobile or other device that you may have made available to those
    services, including information about your contacts on those services. For
    example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our
    Site to your contacts or to pool information about your contacts so you can
    connect with them on or through our Site. Some social networking services
    also will facilitate your registration for the Site or enhance or
    personalize your experience on the Site. Your decision to use a social
    networking service in connection with the Site is voluntary. However, you
    should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third-party
    social networking services may make available to the Site by visiting those
    service(s) privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy setting directly
    with those services. TrailSteps applies the terms of this Privacy Policy to
    all personally identifiable information and other information about you and
    your computer, mobile or other device that it receives through third-party
    social networking services.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ion-text-left">6. Third-Party Web Sites</h3>
  <p>
    6.1 The Site contains links to other web sites that are not under our
    control, even though some of them may feature the TrailSteps logo through a
    marketing agreement with us. TrailSteps cannot be held responsible for the
    privacy practices of third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover
    information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and
    online sites, applications, destinations or services linked to or from the
    Site. It is recommended that you review the privacy policy of any web site
    you visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    6.2 On occasion, TrailSteps sponsors special promotions, sweepstakes, and
    contests that are hosted by partner web sites, which may require that your
    browser accept cookies, or that you agree to receive information from such
    sponsors. Please note that 6.1 is fully applicable to said partner web
    sites.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">7. Security</h3>
  <p>
    TrailSteps takes highly serious security measures designed to guard access
    to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where
    information is stored. The Site has security measures in place to help
    protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
    control and uses encryption technology where appropriate. TrailSteps cannot,
    however, guarantee the confidentiality of any communication transmitted to
    or from TrailSteps via the Site or e-mails. Accordingly, TrailSteps is not
    responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">8. Notice to California Residents</h3>
  <p>
    California Civil Code Section 179883 permits California residents to request
    certain information regarding the disclosure of personal information to
    third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please
    contact TrailSteps at <b>privacy@trailsteps.com</b>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">9. Transfer of Information</h3>
  <p>
    Your information may be transferred to and maintained on, servers and
    databases located outside of your state, providence, country or other
    governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as
    your jurisdiction. Please be advised that TrailSteps may transfer your
    information to and from any state, province, country or other governmental
    jurisdiction, and process it in the United States or elsewhere. Your consent
    to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
    represents your agreement to any such transfer.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">10. Information Security and Notification</h3>
  <p>
    10.1 Because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of
    physical or electronic security is impenetrable, TrailSteps cannot guaranty
    the security of the information you submit or the security of servers,
    networks or databases, and by using the Site, you agree to assume all risk
    in connection with the information submitted to or collected by TrailSteps
    when you access, visit and/or use the Site including, without limitation,
    your personally identifiable information, and TrailSteps is not responsible
    for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    10.2 Should you elect to store information, such as your personally
    identifiable information where others may access it, TrailSteps is not
    responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof. If
    you lose a computer, mobile or other device that contains your personally
    identifiable information, it is up to you to take all the steps necessary to
    avoid or protect yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    10.3 In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your
    information in TrailSteps’s possession or control may have been compromised,
    TrailSteps may seek to notify you via your computer, mobile or other device.
